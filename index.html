            In the Lynda challenge, the goal was to calculate the mean and median of the wind speed,
            air temperature, and barometric pressure, recorded at the Deep Moor station
            for a given range of dates using javascript as the chosen language. The data
            would be taken from a list the US Navy compiles during their submarine testing in Lake Pend Oreille.
            Weather statistics such as wind speed, air temperature, and barometric
            pressure should be ajaxed in by using a restful api that returned a jsonp object filled with data from this site:
            http://lpo.dt.navy.mil.
            </p>
            <h4>Reflections</h4>
            <p>
            For this exercise I was just concentrating on getting a successful response from
            the api and writing a mean and median functionality. After comparing my solutions to the offered
            solutions, there were a few things that really stood out to me that I hope
            to take away. Firstly, the lynda solutions did a much better job of
            abstracting out the functionality and keeping code simple. For example, their solutions to the mean function simply
            takes an array argument and uses the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce">reduce</a>
            method to add everything up in that array argument, and simply divides that
            sum by the total number of the items in the array. The final step was
            setting the returned mean to a nicer fixed point value.
            <br />
            I'm happy that my mean solution returned the correct mean values, but
            becuase I didn't know about the reduce method I feel that my function was a bit more
            cumbersome. Instead, I used a for loop to loop through the length of the
            array, and used the counter to slice each individual item into a variable to be parsed to a
            floating point integer. Then, I used an additional assignment operator to
            add it to a 'MeanTotal' variable. Once the loop was finished, the total sum of the
            array values were divided by the total array length giving the accurate mean value
            (possibly too accurate, I probably should've used the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed">toFixed</a>
            function to return a nice number).
            </p>
            <h4>Going Further</h4>
            <p>
            The lesson went on to actually complete the solution really thouroughly. They visualized the
            data and created drop down menus to dynamically update the range of dates. While
            those weren't in the scope of my personal goal for the challenge, I
            followed along and completed the interesting parts of the challenge. It was
            really the first time I had seen and used the <a
            href="http://c3js.org/">c3</a> library, which is an impressive tool. Also,
            it was really good to go through the neccessary steps to massage the data so
            c3 could display the data correctly. It was surprising how much more work that
            was than I had thought about the problem before watching and following their
            suggested solution. Below is the product of their suggested solution.
